This model is created to predict the price of bitcoin which is very famous cryoto currency. I used a dataset available in the kaggel. In this model firstly, ETL process is done using the pandas and then data is split
in 4:1 4 for train and 1 for testing the data.
Then convert the data into the matrix.
After that start the buiding of the model.
and then compaire the results with the root mean squared method of test and train data.
At last output is generated in the form of line graph.
